## Callback events

> Callback events are simple $.events triggerd by Owl in strategic code locations. This gives you ability to listen for any changes and perform your own actions.

On the [next page](callback-functions.html) you'll find a list of sibiling Callback Functions with exacly the same behavior but slightly different names.


```
var owl = $('.owl-carousel');
owl.owlCarousel();
// Listen to owl events:

owl.on('changed.owl.carousel',function(){
	...
})

```
